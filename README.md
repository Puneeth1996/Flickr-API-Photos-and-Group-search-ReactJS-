Not used any Routing 

Just worked with the React app

Have used the flickr api 
    method=flickr.photos.search


The program made to work with search input and the number of images to be show in the page ( its kinda lazy loading paradigm that can be implemeted full feldgedly)



Run the program by 
After downloading the repository 

npm install 
npm start ( this should fire a local deployment server in localhost:3000)
