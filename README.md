React Project

Run the program by 
After downloading the repository 

npm install 
npm start ( this should fire a local deployment server in localhost:3000)


Flickr API : Photos and Group search, dummy Charts(Couldnot find the Flickr API end points for likes/faves and comments to show the same using charts ...)


The program made to work with search input and the number of images to be show in the page ( its kinda lazy loading paradigm that can be implemeted full feldgedly)

Have used the flickr api 
    method=flickr.photos.search
